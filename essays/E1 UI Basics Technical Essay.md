I started BrowserHistory1 the way that it was reccommended by first reading all the material. As a hands on type of learner, I found it difficult to just recall things that I needed to complete the WOD within the time limit. It led to a lot of frustration because I was sure that there was a better way to do things and got caught up on the details. Repeating the WOD after watching the solution I was able to bring my time down to something I was okay with even though I still have a lot of room to improve.

BrowserHistory2 was a lot easier than the first in that it was more about just modifying and defining objects with clear and simple things to remember. I easily reached Rx. BrowserHistory3 was by far the most frustrating in that there weren't instructions or much guidance. The open ended nature of the WOD meant that I had to look everywhere and honestly I was overwhelmed with the amount of information and methods. In the end I use the solution video to guide me and was able to finish it but have not yet reached a satisfactory time.
