The Invoice1 WOD generates a sales reciept using JS expressions. The WOD details can be found [here.](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html)

I find that gasping expressions around objects and variables with the functions of scripts is just flat out easier than the previous WODs that had a lot of hard coding. Overall I didn't think it was too hard to use a script to display everything once I understood how it all came together. Although most of it was straightforward, I struggled with the time display because it wasn't very intuitive. 

To prepare, I did all the readings and did the little hands-on stuff but it didn't quite prepare me overall for what was really being asked and I benefitted far more by practicing the task at hand. I know that I am a hands-on learner and only practical, as needed methods work for me.

For the Next WOD I think I can save time and learn a lot more by getting more familiar through watching and doing it hands on rather than trying to shove a bunch of concepts into my head since only being a little familiar does nothing in a practical sense. I either know it or I don't.
