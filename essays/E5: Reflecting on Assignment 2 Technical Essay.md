1. Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to [this page.](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2_retrospective.html) for further details.

  Assignment 2 is centered around server-side processing and the exchange of data and information to include persistent data, data validation, data creation and storage.

2. What did you learn from this assignment?

  The main take away from this project is how routes work it was and is still very difficult to get it to work right the first time and considering that I lacked proficient understanding I found that I stumbled around and struggled nearly the entire time. Persistent data, validation, creation and data input and the worst getting it all to save. There is a ton that I am continuing to learn and grasp but doing this showed me that if I really want to say I learned it that I definitely need to do it more and work harder.

3. Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).

  No, I am currently playing catch up and my only partner is my laptop and the internet.

4. How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?

  I spent a LOT of time looking at screencasts, using google, going to stack overflow, and looking at the code and examples of my classmates. To put it simply I needed help with everything.

5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?

  Assignment 2 is totally different than 1 in that assignment 1 is so much simpler. It’s just doing simple checks and validation whereas 2 is so much more complex in asking for several things and having to come of with the code for things that all have to work together without breaking anything.

6. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging

  Percentage wise I would say I spent 20% thinking about how I wanted it to go, 30% figuring out code that worked for me and 50% testing and trying to fix my eventual problems and get it to work.

7. Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?

  Understanding the concepts and how it comes together was the easiest part. It’s all very logical and makes total sense however the implementation of the concepts for me anyway was difficult. Taking the training wheels off and really floundering for a while. I just need to be more proficient and comfortable with non-linear solutions.

8. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?

  I would spend more time being creative and more time getting comfortable with having lots of options to a solution instead of just one and ensuring my mindset reflected that.
