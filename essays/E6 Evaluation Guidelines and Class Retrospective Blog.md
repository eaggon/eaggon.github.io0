## Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)

My system is a store that sells candy/sweets related art.

## Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?

When I try and run the application from the class server it just stops, and I am unable to get it to work beyond a local serve and I have no idea where I went wrong with it. I am sure given enough time I could figure it out, but I struggled with everything.

## Describe what you are most proud of about your system:

I am honestly just proud that I was able to get it to do what I wanted to even just locally. It authenticates, encrypts, and can carry and store data.

## Describe what you are least happy with your system:

As I mentioned prior, I cannot get it to serve anything because it just stays stopped instead of online and I do not know what the problem is.

## How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?

I was too far behind to really focus on assignment 2 and just worked on getting 3 to work since Professor Port warned that 2 and 3 are nothing alike.

## When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?

I looked at screencasts, used google, stack overflow, asked questions on forums, reddit, classmate examples. It was frustrating to say the least and at this point I am delirious from lack of sleep.

## Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?

For the things that I did spend more time on learning and truly understanding instead of just mindlessly copying or following that time investment paid off a lot.

## Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?

Overestimating my ability to just get in here and figure it out. That does NOT work here. I had to go back and look at stuff over and over and over while basically beating my head on a wall to even get anywhere.

## What did you learn from doing this assignment?

I learned that taking your time, being careful, and deliberate is the best thing you can do for yourself besides having the patience to deal with the unexpected.

## If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?

Respect the material. I admit that I did not, and I definitely could change that.

## Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging

Thinking – 20% / Writing – 20% / Testing & Debug – 60%

## Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)

Technically it was 100% me but if I’m really being honest, it was a lot of Professor Port’s instruction, screencasts, classmate examples, and the internet in general.
