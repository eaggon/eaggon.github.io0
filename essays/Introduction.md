A little bit about myself, I was born in Reno, Nevada but spent most of my early life in Las Vegas. My family moved to Hawaii where I spent my last three years of school before joining the U.S. Army. I served for 10 years and am now a civillain in the process of obtaining a degree in Management Information Systems.

After exiting the military, I didn't have a clear direction in regards to which degree to pursue. I didn't want to commit to computer science and straight business tracks weren't compelling enough. MIS fits nicely between the two choices and appears to have an automation proof future. As of now that is the path I've chosen.
